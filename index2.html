                <h1>Subhas Chandra Bose</h1>
                <p>Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the high
                    noon of the British Raj.
                    The early recipient of an unusually Anglocentric education, his teenage and young adult years were
                    interspersed with brilliant academic success, oversize religious yearning, and stark rebellion
                    against authority.
                    In a college in which his five brothers had preceded him, he was expelled for participating in an
                    assault on a professor. He was also rusticated from the University of Calcutta, but after
                    reinstatement 18 months later he managed to study blamelessly and excel academically.</p>

                <p>Bhagat Singh (Punjabi pronunciation: [pə̀ɡət̪ sɪ́ŋɡ] (About this soundlisten) 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India 
                    and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.</p>

                <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
                <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/;[2] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[3] anti-colonial nationalist,[4] and political ethicist,[5] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule,[6] and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. 
                    The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world

                    subsequently, the first Prime Minister of India, as well as a central figure in Indian politics both before and after independence. 
                    He emerged as an eminent leader of the Indian independence movement, serving India as Prime Minister from its establishment in 1947 as an independent nation, until his death in 1964. 
                    He was also known as Pandit Nehru due to his roots with the Kashmiri Pandit community, while Indian children knew him better as Chacha Nehru (Hindi: Uncle Nehru)</p>
